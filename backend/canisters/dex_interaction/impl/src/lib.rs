# Buyback adn burn canister

The canister is designed to support a deflationary tokenomics model by recieving
ICP tokens from various sources and selling them on a decentralized exchange (DEX).
The obtained GOLDAO tokens are then sent to a minting address to be burned,
thereby reducing the token supply over time.
